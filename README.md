# British Airways Reviews Tableau Dashboard Project

This project uses British Airways reviews and country datasets to create an interactive Tableau dashboard. It is part of my ongoing data challenge, where I aim to complete 100 data projects.

**Data Source:** British Airways review data and a country dataset.

**Skills used:** Data visualization, Dashboard design in Tableau.

## Project Overview

The project is broken down into 5 parts, with 4 visualizations compiled into a final dashboard:

### Part 1: Map Visualization
This visualization presents a world map where users can interactively select different parameters and metrics, such as:
- Overall rating
- Cabin staff rating
- Traveler type
- Seat type

Two side-by-side horizontal bar charts display:
- Aircraft type vs. average overall rating
- Aircraft type vs. the number of reviews
